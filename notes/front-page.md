# Front Page
My idea is that the text answers questions about Computing, Cloud, and Data services in general. For example, what resources different services provide to the user, concrete examples of common uses of the services, and a general comparison between the services so that the user can choose the services they need and understand which sections are necessary in the documentation. The texts are intended to make it easier for the user to choose the right services and get started.
