# Learn Cloud Service by Developing and Deploying a Web Application
This tutorial will teach you how to use CSC's cloud services, [Pouta]() and [Rahti](), by developing a web application and deploying it. The tutorial assumes basic knowledge of the Linux operating system, Git version control system, Julia language, and SQL databases. We recommend reading the Linux basics tutorial for understanding basic [Linux command line usage]().

You can find the web application from the [**csc-training/GenieWebApp.jl**](https://github.com/csc-training/GenieWebApp.jl) repository. You can use Git to clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csc-training/GenieWebApp.jl.git
```

The [**documentation**](https://csc-training.github.io/GenieWebApp.jl/dev/) contains in-depth instruction on developing and deploying the application using a web user interface and command-line interface to a virtual machine on Pouta with OpenStack and OpenShift container platform on Rahti.
