# Goals
Test CSC's cloud services from the customer standpoint.

- Test virtual machines on Pouta using OpenStack.

- Test OpenShift container platform on Rahti.


Only use publicly available resources.

- Primarily docs.csc.fi.


Find ways to improve the documentation, especially for beginners.

- Is the documentation structure friendly for beginners?

- Are relevant concepts well explained?

- Is some important information missing or over looked?


I had only small amount of prior experience in cloud computing before the summer 2021.

This allowed me to look at the cloud documentation from a beginner's perspective.
