# Approach
## Idea
Learn web technologies, computer networking and cloud computing by developing a simple MCV web application and deploying it to each of the cloud services.

Understanding how a web application works is essential for understanding cloud computing and being motivated to learn it.

Assumes basic understanding of Linux operating system, command line interface and programming.


## Practice
I chose Julia Language with Genie framework, which is similar to Django or Ruby-on-Rails.

Why [Julia language](https://julialang.org/)?

* Future programming language, designed for technical computing
* Easier to learn than other programming languages
* Close to C in performance: https://julialang.org/benchmarks/
* Uses multiple-dispatch as a paradigm, leads to highly composable code (Object-oriented in single dispatch), [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Multiple Dispatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY)

Explore basic web application fuctionality by implementing a simple REST API with HTML and JSON endpoints.

- HTML endpoint to demonstrate usage via browser
- JSON endpoint to demonstrate programmatic usage

Deploy the application on Pouta and Rahti using the web user interface and command line interface.

Document the step-by-step deployment process and explain each step.
