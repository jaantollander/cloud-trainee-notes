# Practice
I chose Julia Language with Genie framework, which is similar to Django or Ruby-on-Rails.


Why [Julia language](https://julialang.org/)?

* Future programming language, designed for technical computing
* Easier to learn than other programming languages
* Close to C in performance: https://julialang.org/benchmarks/
* Uses multiple-dispatch as a paradigm, leads to highly composable code (Object-oriented in single dispatch), [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Multiple Dispatch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY)


Explore basic web application fuctionality by implementing a simple REST API with HTML and JSON endpoints.

- HTML endpoint to demonstrate usage via browser
- JSON endpoint to demonstrate programmatic usage and building APIs


Deploy the application on Pouta and Rahti using

1) the web user interface and
2) the command line interface.


Document the step-by-step deployment process and explain each step.
