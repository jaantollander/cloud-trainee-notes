# Deploying to Virtual Machine on Pouta using OpenStack
Create virtual machine via OpenStack web user interface or command line interface.

1) Login to web user interface or configure command line interface
2) Configure SSH keys
    - Needed for accessing a virtual machine
3) Create a virtual machine
4) Configure security groups
    - Expose IPs and port for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS connections
5) Configure floating IP
    - Configure publicly accessable IP address for the virtual machine
6) Configure persistent storage


Deploy application manually from the command line interface.

1) Find domain name
    - For example: `vm3814.kaj.pouta.csc.fi`
2) Connect to virtual machine via SSH
3) Attach persistent storage
4) Install Julia language
5) Install Genie application
6) Run the Genie application
7) Configure Nginx server
8) Enable HTTPS via Certbot (that is, Let's encrypt)


Results

- https://pouta.csc.fi
- https://vm3814.kaj.pouta.csc.fi/


Main points

- Setting SSH keys from command line was somewhat ambiguous.
- We should better explain security groups.
- How to configure security groups properly?
- We should explain CIDR subnet masks.
