Main points

- We should better explain how to set up OpenShift permissions inside a container. Permissions can be challenging to configure properly. For example, the container may work fine locally but not on OpenShift.
- Is there a better way to test if the container works on OpenShift than having to deploy it?
- Change to OKD4 will significantly improve the web user interface.
